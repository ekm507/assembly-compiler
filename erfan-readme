alloc arrays dynamically after getting file size

##*HOW TO REMOVE COMMENTS AND OTHER USELESS THINGS:*

#*Method 1:*
read the file char-by-char.
when you get any ';' then you change it and any chars after it with a ';'  .
(if there is any other comment type, remove it in this level).
then start reading the file once again.
when you get newline characters(ASCII = 10) do this:
until you haven't reached any character other than[ newline character or space character if 
';' ] , change any character you see with ';'.
when you get space characters simultanuesly more than one, change the others wuth ';'.
**Finally** remove all the ';' from the code.
*proof of work:*
I have done prooving it, so dont worry :))))
